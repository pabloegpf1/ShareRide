# ShareRide
SFHacks 2019 project: Ride sharing iOS app made for students.

### Overview
ShareRide is an app that helps you cover the expenses of your daily commute. Publish where and when you are leaving home and people will be able to join you. After the dropoff, the costs of the ride (estimated by our super complex algorithm) will be divided between all the people that went with you.

Do you live off campus? are you tired of public transport? Check our ride list and see who's driving close to your destination.
